            <h1>YOSHI</h1>
            <p>Yoshi (ヨッシー?, Yosshī, sometimes referred to as Yossy) is a member of the fictional dinosaur species of the same name who appears in various video game series published by Nintendo. Yoshis, commonly green, can also be found in various colors such as red, yellow, blue, pink etc. Yoshi debuts as an ally of the protagonists Mario and Luigi in the video game Super Mario World (1990). In the main Super Mario series, Yoshi typically takes on the role of steed for Mario. <br>

                Over the years he has become a major Nintendo character, becoming the titular protagonist of the Yoshi series and a supporting character in the Mario spin-off video games. </p>

            <p>Yoshi is a green example of the homonymous race living in different colors in the Land of Dinosaurs. Equipped with an extendable tongue, he has various abilities including being ridden like a horse by Mario. For this reason he is sometimes represented with a saddle instead of the shell placed on his back. <br>

                Yoshi eats everything and getting between him and the food represents a losing challenge from the start. The body has a bright green shade with a white belly, it also has a red shell on its back, three orange scales behind its head and boots of the same color. It has a very long and sticky tongue with which it can grasp practically anything, even things that are much larger than itself, similar to frogs; despite having many teeth, they have rarely been seen or used in his video game appearances </p>
